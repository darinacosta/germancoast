    <p id="norco-growth-context">Heavy industry is the most distinct visible characteristic of Norco's landscape. Industrial growth has occurred in 3 stages: plantations turned over to industrial land uses, the  footprints of these industrial facilities broadened, and finally heavy industry came to dominate and even displace other land uses.

      As petroleum companies moved into Louisiana, they sought land that was plentiful and cheap in order to construct refineries. The "River Parishes" between Baton Rouge and New Orleans along the Mississippi River proved an ideal location. It hosted vast acres of idle land, a legacy of Louisiana's once-robust plantation economy. The river itself provided access to Gulf oil fields, and could serve as a coolant for machinery as well as a toxic waste sink. Additionally, this land nearest to the river was the most evelvated and least flood-prone in region due to many hundreds of years of sediment deposition by the Mississppi River.

      Many former slaves settled the plantation land upon which they once labored following the Civil War, often occupying towns and villages directly along the riverfront. When the lower Mississippi became a site of rapid petro-industrial development, these freed slave communities became the unwitting neighbors of heavy industry.

      Due to the benefits of siting petrochemical facilities along the Mississippi River, industrial facilities spread rapidly across the German Coast's riverfront during the first half of the 20th century. Royal Dutch Shell initiated this trend in 1916 when it purchased the 366 acre Good Hope plantation tract. Over time the tract grew into a massive oil refinery. As the facility expanded, it <a href="./assets/i/good_hope_change_v1.jpg" class="image-link geometry-link" title="This series of topographical maps documents the gradual disappearance of Good Hope, highlighted in red (USGS 1952, 1967, & 1992).">bought out and ultimately devoured</a> what was once the small port town of Good Hope.
