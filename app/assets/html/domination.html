    <span style="font-size:22px">A</span>s petroleum companies moved into Louisiana, they sought land that was plentiful and cheap in order to construct refineries. The "River Parishes" between Baton Rouge and New Orleans along the Mississippi River were an ideal location. It hosted vast acres of idle land, a legacy of Louisiana's once-robust plantation economy. The river itself provided access to Gulf oil fields, and could serve as a coolant for machinery as well as a toxic waste sink. The land nearest to the river was also the most elevated and least flood-prone in the region due to many hundreds of years of sediment deposition by the Mississppi River, which built up natural levees along its banks.

    Due to these siting benefits, <a class="industrial-facilities geometry-link">industrial facilities spread rapidly across the German Coast's riverfront</a> throughout the 20th century. Royal Dutch Shell initiated this trend in 1916 when it purchased the 366 acre Good Hope plantation tract. Over time the tract grew into a massive oil refinery. As the facility expanded, it bought out and ultimately devoured what was once the small port town of <a class="geometry-link goodhope">Good Hope</a>.

When the lower Mississippi became a site of rapid petro-industrial development, these freed slave communities became the unwitting neighbors of heavy industry. Such was the case for the village of Sellers in the town now called <a class="geometry-link norco-boundary">NORCO (New Orleans Refining Company)</a>.
