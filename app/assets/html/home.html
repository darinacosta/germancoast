     <h3>Geographies of Southwestern Lake Pontchartrain & Beyond</h3>
     <p>The southwestern rim of Louisiana's Lake Pontchartrain is a complex mosaic of denuded swamplands, oil infrastructure, and highway sprawl. 
     This page hosts a series of interrelated multi-media vignettes that provide a tour of the region and emphasize its unique 
     geographic features. Please begin by observing a few of the broader characteristics of the River Parish landscape, such as  
     the <a class="geometry-link" id="parishline-geofeature-event">stark divide between swamp and suburb</a> along the St. Charles/Jefferson parish line;
     <a class="geometry-link" id="erosion-geofeature-event">saltwater erosion</a> along the shores of the lake; 
     <a class="geometry-link" id="ej-geofeature-event">residential areas sandwiched between refineries</a>; others that extend
     into <a class="geometry-link" id="suburb-geofeature-event">precarious floodplains</a>;
     and the telltale <a class="geometry-link" id="radial-geofeature-event">radial canals</a> of cypress logging.<p>
