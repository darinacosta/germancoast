      <h1>Real Estate Speculation</h1>
      <h2>in the LaBranche Wetlands</h2>

    <hr>
    <p>In the 1970s, as residential demand in St. Charles Parish increased, private real estate developers began purchasing tracts of land deep in the LaBranche Wetlands. Many investors in the area believed that the Army Corps of Engineers would build a hurricane protection levee along the shore of Lake Pontchartrain, thus making their properties eligible for federally subsidized flood insurance.</p>

      <p>During this period, the Walker Land Company sold many parcels in the <a class="geometry-link labranche-industrial-park">LaBranche Industrial Park</a>. Soon the company was under investigatizon by the U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for failing to address certain "particulars" of the development before selling the properties, such as:<br><br><ul><li>Failing to disclose in the property report to HUD that a "marina, boat-town, golf course, tennis courts, motel, and regional shopping center" would be constructed, as promised in advertising.</li><li>Failing to address who would be responsible for draining lots below sea level (ie, would it be the responsibility of the purchaser to foot the bill?).</li><li>Failing to address how access to all lots would be achieved since there weren't any streets or roads.</li></ul></p>
    <p>Ultimately, wetland preservation policies forced the Army Corps to <a class="geometry-link airline-levee">reroute the levee</a>, which now runs roughly parallel to Airline Highway and less than a quarter of a mile to its north. This has made development of the wetlands financially infeasible. Individuals who bought parcels from the Walker Land Company and other developers now own parcels that are submerged beneath as much as 15 feet of water.
