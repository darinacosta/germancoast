It smells like, like it's a person working on the road or something and you know you smell these chemicals and it's not so much of a bad smell it's more of a toxic smell like asphalt and other chemical smells. And it constantly burns my nose and I can't breathe as well as it takes me some sleeping at night and sometimes I even stop breathing I do. I suffer with sleep apnea but I'm so afraid since I've been breathing in this pollution because I'm constantly dizzy and they haven't found out any reasons why and my fingers are numb all the time and like I said my respiratory system it's just, it's just devastated. And I would just like you to know from February the 1st, the end of January today as well as the first has been a low-grade smell but I can still smell it. And again my name is Barbara Green. My number is area code 504-401-439. Thank you.\n\n\n","pubDate":"Mon, 02 Feb 2015 04:07:00 GMT","category":"Odor","id":"14437"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.093663,29.899362]},"properties":{"title":"Sweet Funky Smell in Marrero - made me feel nauseous","link":"http://map.labucketbrigade.org/reports/view/14447","description":"Hi.
